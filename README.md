A 2D top-down libGDX game that features a game world where a player can simply move around and collide with other entities (for now?). This project is used to practice the principle of composition using the [Entity-Component-System (ECS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_component_system) pattern.

## Libraries
- [Ashley](https://github.com/libgdx/ashley) is used to implement the ECS pattern.
- [Box2D](https://libgdx.com/wiki/extensions/physics/box2d) is used to implement the game physics.
